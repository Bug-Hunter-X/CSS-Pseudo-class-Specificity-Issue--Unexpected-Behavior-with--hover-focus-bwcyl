The CSS code has an unexpected behavior when applying multiple pseudo-classes to an element. For example, consider the following code:

```css
a:hover:focus {
  background-color: yellow;
}
```

In some browsers, this code might not work as expected when both :hover and :focus are triggered simultaneously.  The expected behavior is that the background color turns yellow, however it might not or might display some unexpected behavior.

This is often due to the order of specificity and how the browser interprets the cascade of styles. The issue is subtle and might not always be reproducible across browsers.
