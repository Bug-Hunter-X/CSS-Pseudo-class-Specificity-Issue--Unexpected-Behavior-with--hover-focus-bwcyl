# CSS Pseudo-class Specificity Issue

This repository demonstrates an uncommon issue related to CSS pseudo-class specificity. The problem involves unexpected behavior when applying multiple pseudo-classes to an element, particularly `:hover:focus`.

## Problem

In certain browsers and under specific conditions, the expected styling changes might not apply when both `:hover` and `:focus` are triggered.  The issue is subtle and may not manifest across all browsers or browser versions.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.css` file shows a possible solution (though a complete fix requires a deeper understanding of the browser's rendering engine). This might involve more explicit and granular styling or a different approach to achieving the desired behavior.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` (if created) in your browser.
3. Interact with the element to trigger `:hover` and `:focus` simultaneously.
4. Observe whether the expected style changes occur.

This issue highlights the complexities of CSS specificity and the importance of thorough cross-browser testing.
